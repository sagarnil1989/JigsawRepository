The bike rental company wants to estimate the demand ( # of rides at any given point of time)  B2:B17380

# First step 
-- Number of observations - 17380 ( nrow)
-- Number of variable/Cols/Feature - 12 (ncol)
-- Type of variables - (str on dataframe)  -- Why ??
   Numeric ( Cont, Discrete) 
   Categorical variables - Weekday ( 0 to 6 ) 
   Boolean/Binary variable - Holiday ( 0, 1) 
-- Univariate Analysis ( Exploration of a variable at a time)
   Numeric 
   Rider -- HOW TO EXPLAIN A CONT VARIABLE 
     -- Measure of central tendency - Mean, Median and Mode 
            Mean   = 190 - On an average 190 riders borrow bikes at any given point of time 
            Median = 142 - 50% of the time, number of riders are less than 142 & 50% of the time they are more than 142
                     1,9,5,8,3 
                     1,3,5,8,9
            Mode   = 5   - A lot of time, there are 5 riders borrowing the bike 
           Mean is when you don't have outliers in the data 
           Median is when you have outliers in the data 
           # Find out average age of the class participants 
           #  18, 20, 19, 24, 54 
              mean = 27 
              median = 20  
      -- Measure of range ( Min, Max, Variance, Std deviation)
           Variance/Std deviation = it let us know how data is spread, on an avg how much a data point is away from mean 
           Theorem of variance  ( Cheybeshev theorem - atleast 75% of the data lies between 2 SD of mean)
            
      -- Percentile in R ? fivenum( )
      -- Measure of shape - Skewnesss - Data is positively skewed 
                            Kurtosis - Measure of peakdness of data 
      -- Missing Values 

Categorical values - Frequency distribution 

 - Bivariate - Multivariate Analysis 
   
  Pivot table in R - ( Gender, State) 
                   table( Gender, State) 
                   summarize - (Hmisc package)
                   tapply, lapply 

HYPOTHESIS TESTING - 

-- This works on a sample 
-- Used for inferential analysis

Steps of hypothesis testing - 
Step-1 => Define Null Hypothesis [ H0] - There is no difference between sample and population 
Step-2 => Define Alternate Hypothesis [ Ha ] - There is a difference between sample and population 
Step-3 => Define Confidence level         - 95% , 90% , 99.9% 
Step-4 => Alpha value ( Cut-off p-value)  - 0.05, 0.10, 0.001
Step-5 => You will run test ( normal, t-test, anova, chi-square) and you will p-value 
Step-6 => Compare p-value with alpha value 
Step-7 => Reject or Fail to reject null hypothesis 
          Reject - When p value is lesser than Alpha [ P LOW NULL GO ] 
          Fail to reject - When p value is more than Alpha 


When sample size is more than 30 we can use Normal Distribution 
When sample size is less than 30 which distribution ( T-distribution ) 

We are doing 1 - T, because sample average is higher than population avg 


I want to test whether female employees are paid less than mail employees 

I need to do 2-sample T-test ?

Paired - When you have same object - ( before/After)
Equ variance 
Unequal variance - 

Do a F-Test and firnd out variance between the group is same or not 


ANOVA - In R-studio

Chi-square test - Works for count data 

We want to test when sachin scores a century team wins ot not ?

## ANOVA 
# When you have more than 2-sample 
# ANOVA test ( Analysis of variance)

# IDVs - Categorical variables
# DV - Contionous variables

# One-way Anova - When you have one categorical IDV
# Two-way Anova - When you have more than one categorical IDV

# lets find out group means 
aggregate(response, by=list(trt), FUN = mean)
# average chol reduction in each of the group 
# Group E has shown the highest reduction 
# Group 1Time has shown the lowest 

# Test the group difference 
# I need to run ANOVA test

# Groups are different...
# Which gorups are different and which are not ??
